Every night, memories flooded back—gunfire, explosions, the faces of people lost. One night, a loud sound from outside made his heart race. He froze, his mind taken back to the battlefield. The feeling of danger, the fear, it was all too real. He tried to shake it off, but it was hard. At work, he couldn’t focus. Even the simplest noises made him jump. His friends didn’t understand, and that made him feel even more alone. The hardest part was when he saw a child playing in the park. It reminded him of the innocent lives lost in the war. His hands shook, but he took a deep breath, reminding himself that he was home now. Healing was slow, but he knew he had to keep going.\"\n",
